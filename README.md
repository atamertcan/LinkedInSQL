# LinkedInSQL
Made for CS50-SQL course.

## General Information
- Made with SQLite.
- Main purpose of the project is self-improvement in SQL and databases.
- LinkedIn is “the world’s largest professional network” with a mission to “connect the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful.” Perhaps you have an account? On the platform, users can post their professional experience (i.e., past jobs, education, etc.) and make connections with other people they’ve met, in-person or online.
- Task at hand is to create a SQLite database for LinkedIn from scratch
